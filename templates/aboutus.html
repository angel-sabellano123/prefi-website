      Founded by Angel Sabellano, Purely Handmade is a small passion project turned into a space where people can find joy
      in uniquely handmade items. From soft toys and scarves to baskets and blankets, each product is made with
      high-quality yarn and a lot of love.

      Our mission is to support local artistry, bring comfort through crafts, and share the warmth of handmade
      with every customer. Whether you're buying for yourself or a gift for someone special, we hope our creations
      bring a smile to your heart.
